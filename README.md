Task:
The e-scooter company Gans is looking to expanding into the European market. They are most 
interested in the German speaking markets where there are already some well established 
companies such as Tier and Bird in the scene. Gansâ€™ operational success depends on whether 
they can optimize the supply and demand of their scooters, which means they have to place 
their scooters at locations where the users need them. With 
that, Gans need to collect data such as geographical information and population, weather, 
airports of the city and flight arrivals to those airports
